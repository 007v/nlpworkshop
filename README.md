We will be doing a broad overview of NLP. We will be going through some
applications using the R programming language. It is not necessary to 
know R nor code during this workshop. If you would like to try out the
code on your own machine during the workshop, please download R ahead
of time [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
If you have questions about installation please e-mail Taylor Arnold
at taylor.arnold@yale.edu.
